Hello my name is Sofia, I am a third-year Statistics Undergraduate student at UCLA, and I am here to interview...</p><p>Hi guys! I'm Midori and I am a fourth-year Physiological Sciences major and minor in Global Health. Thanks so much for having me Sofia.</p><p>Of course! Alright, we are just going to interview Midori about her upbringing as a mixed student and just some scenarios that she had to deal with while growing up. My first question for you is, how did being a mixed student affect your upbringing?</p><p>Yeah! So I am half Japanese and half White. Being mixed really affected my identity growing up, I never felt like I belonged in either of those categories. However, I feel like a lot of my peers and friends labeled me as Japanese and kind of ignored the other side of me. So I definitely dealt with a lot of discrimination for being Japanese even though I am mixed as well. </p><p>Wow! Thank you for sharing that, I really appreciate it. My next question would be, how had being mixed affected your time at UCLA and has UCLA offered enough materials and resources for you to feel included on campus?</p><p>I never really felt in touch with my identity and I wish I did join a lot more mixed organizations. I definitely attended a couple of Mixed Student Union club meetings which were really fun and allowed me to explore how I felt about it. I never really thought about what it meant to me to be mixed, and I think I identified more with my Japanese side because of how I grew up.</p><p>Awesome! Yeah, I definitely have felt the same way. My last question to you would be how has being mixed affected your mental health?</p><p>Being mixed, again, definitely affected how I felt who I was and my identity, and not really feeling like I was apart of something specific. I never felt like I fit in with the Japanese community or the White community as well. But, if I visited the Japanese side of my family I felt more connected to them and the same with my White family. I also definitely look different than both sides of my family, a lot of people do not believe I am related to my mom completely or my dad or even my grandparents completely, and I felt like that definitely effected how I view myself. I never really found a community that felt right with me.</p><p>Yeah, and I feel like that is how a lot of Mixed students feel, and thank you so much for sharing your story Midori. That will be it for our podcast today, thanks for listening!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsofiavillalpando.github.io%2Fdh150finalproject%2Finterview-with-a-mixed-student-at-ucla%2F&amp;via=%40sofialpando&amp;text=Interview%20with%20a%20Mixed%20Student%20at%20UCLA" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsofiavillalpando.github.io%2Fdh150finalproject%2Finterview-with-a-mixed-student-at-ucla%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span></a></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="@sofialpando" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofia-villalpando-b21318231/" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>UCLA DH150 Final Project</p><p> <br>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
