My parents worked for the majority of my childhood, so my father did not have the time to teach me Spanish. The fact that I would be taught in English was also a factor, so I was raised speaking English and did not have much experience with Spanish. Not a lot of kids looked like me, and many of them asked what my background was. Questions roaming from "Why are you so hairy?" to "You can't be Mexican, why don't you speak any Spanish?" often made me feel conflicted. The absence of any cultural celebrations at school also made me feel that I could not identify with my Hispanic peers, while my physical characteristics made me feel like I could not identify as white. I was either too White to be Mexican, or too Mexican to be White. Not being able to feel comfortable with my peers because of my ethnicity and race contributed to the downfall of my mental health and performance as a student. I was constantly trying to win the approval of others, then beating myself up when I did not feel included. Until I started to attend UCLA.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/IMG_7659.JPG" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_7659-xs.JPG 300w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_7659-sm.JPG 480w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_7659-md.JPG 768w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_7659-lg.JPG 1024w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_7659-xl.JPG 1360w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_7659-2xl.JPG 1600w" alt="" width="2000" height="1333"></figure><p>My intention for this website is to bring attention to the mental health and social affects that being mixed has on students. There are little to no resources for students, so with this website I want to provide evidence that you are not alone if you are mixed and struggling with your identity, as well as provide resources and help to those who are in need. </p><p>The inspiration for this website comes from my journey to finding my identity. I did not address the issues I faced internally growing up until I was diagnosed with major depression disorder and started attending therapy. I want mixed students to know that they are not alone, while bringing awareness to the issues of identity to everyone from all backgrounds. </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/IMG_1802.JPG" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_1802-xs.JPG 300w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_1802-sm.JPG 480w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_1802-md.JPG 768w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_1802-lg.JPG 1024w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_1802-xl.JPG 1360w, https://sofiavillalpando.github.io/dh150finalproject/media/posts/1/responsive/IMG_1802-2xl.JPG 1600w" alt="" width="2000" height="1500"></figure><p>In this site, I review my story, provide resources for mixed students, have an interview with another UCLA student who is mixed, and provide an interactive example that I created to show the discrimination that mixed students are facing today. </p><p>Enjoy, and please connect with me if you have any questions, thoughts, or concerns.
