Hello my name is Sofia, I am a third-year Statistics Undergraduate student at UCLA, and I am here to interview...</p>\n<p>Hi guys! I'm Midori and I am a fourth-year Physiological Sciences major and minor in Global Health. Thanks so much for having me Sofia.</p>\n<p>Of course! Alright, we are just going to interview Midori about her upbringing as a mixed student and just some scenarios that she had to deal with while growing up. My first question for you is, how did being a mixed student affect your upbringing?</p>\n<p>Yeah! So I am half Japanese and half White. Being mixed really affected my identity growing up, I never felt like I belonged in either of those categories. However, I feel like a lot of my peers and friends labeled me as Japanese and kind of ignored the other side of me. So I definitely dealt with a lot of discrimination for being Japanese even though I am mixed as well. </p>\n<p>Wow! Thank you for sharing that, I really appreciate it. My next question would be, how had being mixed affected your time at UCLA and has UCLA offered enough materials and resources for you to feel included on campus?</p>\n<p>I never really felt in touch with my identity and I wish I did join a lot more mixed organizations. I definitely attended a couple of Mixed Student Union club meetings which were really fun and allowed me to explore how I felt about it. I never really thought about what it meant to me to be mixed, and I think I identified more with my Japanese side because of how I grew up.</p>\n<p>Awesome! Yeah, I definitely have felt the same way. My last question to you would be how has being mixed affected your mental health?</p>\n<p>Being mixed, again, definitely affected how I felt who I was and my identity, and not really feeling like I was apart of something specific. I never felt like I fit in with the Japanese community or the White community as well. But, if I visited the Japanese side of my family I felt more connected to them and the same with my White family. I also definitely look different than both sides of my family, a lot of people do not believe I am related to my mom completely or my dad or even my grandparents completely, and I felt like that definitely effected how I view myself. I never really found a community that felt right with me.</p>\n<p>Yeah, and I feel like that is how a lot of Mixed students feel, and thank you so much for sharing your story Midori. That will be it for our podcast today, thanks for listening!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

According to Merriam-Webster, it is \"the distinguishing character or personality of an individual.\" A significant characteristic that defines a person's identity is their race/ethnicity, and mixed students, being more than one race/ethnicity, are faced with the challenge to choose the identity they will be accepted with most.</p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\">Mental Health Effects</h2>\n<p>As all minorities, mixed students face severe mental health effects regarding their upbringing and backlash from their communities. However, mixed students are often overlooked because many of them have traits that give them privilege; for instance, being white-passing. When I came to UCLA, I was intrigued with the amount of diversity and cultural clubs there were, but there were little resources specifically made for mixed students. Being mixed often come with the challenge of deciding which cultural affinity you resonate with most; and that is decided based on the environment you are in. In an article published by the National Library of Medicine, researchers found that \"Adolescents who self-identify as more than 1 race are at higher health and behavior risks. The findings are compatible with interpreting the elevated risk of mixed race as associated with stress.\" Regardless of what a mixed student identifies as, there is always the chance of backlash from their communities.

My parents worked for the majority of my childhood, so my father did not have the time to teach me Spanish. The fact that I would be taught in English was also a factor, so I was raised speaking English and did not have much experience with Spanish. Not a lot of kids looked like me, and many of them asked what my background was. Questions roaming from \"Why are you so hairy?\" to \"You can't be Mexican, why don't you speak any Spanish?\" often made me feel conflicted. The absence of any cultural celebrations at school also made me feel that I could not identify with my Hispanic peers, while my physical characteristics made me feel like I could not identify as white. I was either too White to be Mexican, or too Mexican to be White. Not being able to feel comfortable with my peers because of my ethnicity and race contributed to the downfall of my mental health and performance as a student. I was constantly trying to win the approval of others, then beating myself up when I did not feel included.
